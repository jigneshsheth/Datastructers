/**
 
 Question Given a list of prices on a website, find the two distinct item prices you need to have the lowest shopping cart total
 
 Variations You can start with free shipping at $25 and items of $5, $8, $15, $22.
 
 that meets a free shipping requirement.
 
 There is an n^2 solution that's obvious. n log n that's more efficient. n if you assume all prices are below the free
 
 shipping requirement.
 
 For the O( n ) solution, add the restriction that all items in the catalog are below the free shipping amount and that
 
 there are a huge number of them.
 
 One variation is to say that you can have as many items in the cart as you want to reach the free shipping total.

/**
 
 Optimal solution O(n log n) because of the sort in the middle:
 - parameter productPrices:
 - parameter freeShippingAmt: Thresold for the free shipping
 
 - returns: touple of 2 values
